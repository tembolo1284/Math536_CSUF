This is my first Markdown document.
Let's install tinytex for pdf docs.
```{r}
tinytex::install_tinytex(force=TRUE)
```

Let's load some data.

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Now let's try material from Math530

```{r}
curve(dbeta(x, shape1 = 7, shape2 = 4), 0, 1)
abline(h = dbeta(0.3668031, shape1 = 7, shape2 = 4), col="red")
```
